### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am transitioning from a natural science background, to a data science career. Nevertheless, I bring my analytical thinking to any project I undertake. I enjoy working with machine learning models and creating interactive visualizations. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on adding various projects to my repo and searching for a data science position.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my [portfolio website](https://jodiambra.github.io/) or [resume](https://github.com/jodiambra/jodiambra.github.io/blob/main/files/jacques_diambraodi_ds_resume.pdf).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: jodiambra@gmail.com , [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jodiambra/)
